                        <summary>What exactly is a House Wellness checkup?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">It's a 112-point visual inspection of your home's major systems—roof, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, foundation, and more. We document everything with photos and deliver a prioritized report within 48 hours. Think of it as an annual physical for your home.</div>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is this a certified home inspection?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">No, and that's intentional. Certified home inspections are designed for real estate transactions and typically cost $500–700. House Wellness is a proactive maintenance checkup for homeowners who already own their home and want to stay ahead of problems. We're not licensed home inspectors—we're maintenance professionals.</div>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How is this different from a home inspection for buying/selling?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Real estate inspections are one-time, transaction-focused reports designed to satisfy lenders and buyers. Our checkup is ongoing maintenance—designed to catch problems early, prioritize what needs attention, and help you budget for future repairs. We also don't do invasive testing or code compliance verification.</div>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Will you try to sell me repairs?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Never. Our technicians don't do repairs and aren't paid commission. We have zero financial incentive to exaggerate or upsell. We tell you what we find, prioritize by urgency, and connect you with vetted contractors only if you ask. No pressure, no kickbacks.</div>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How long does the checkup take?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">About 90 minutes for most homes. Larger homes or those with more systems (workshop, secondary suite, pool equipment) may take slightly longer. We don't rush—thoroughness is the whole point.</div>
                    </details>

                        <summary>Do I need to be home?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we ask that someone 18+ be present during the checkup. This lets us point out findings in real-time, answer your questions, and show you exactly what we're looking at. Most homeowners find the walkthrough educational and valuable.</div>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How far in advance do I need to book?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Most checkups are scheduled within 5-7 days of your request. During peak seasons (fall before winter, spring after snowmelt), it may take a bit longer. We offer weekday and Saturday appointments.</div>

                        <summary>How do you inspect the roof with snow on it?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We don't climb on snowy roofs—safety first. For winter bookings, we inspect all interior systems immediately (attic, furnace, plumbing, etc.). Then we return for a complimentary spring visit to inspect the roof, grading, and driveway once the snow melts. Two visits, one price.</div>

                    <details class="faq-item">

                        <div class="faq-answer">Then the checkup is free—that's our Find-Something Guarantee. But honestly, Calgary homes always have something worth monitoring. Between freeze-thaw cycles, Chinooks, aging systems, and deferred maintenance, we've never left a home without useful findings.</div>
